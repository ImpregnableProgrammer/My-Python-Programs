# My-Python-Programs
This repository features a whole host of programs I wrote in Python, the programming language I started out with and hence am the most familiar with. You may find programs here that are extremely frustrating to follow as I was not at all meticulous about documenting my work well when I first began programming. I naturally improved over time, so many others will be much better documented. The inadequately documented aand messy ones are kept in this repository for the sake of maintaining a centralized timeline of where I once was when I started out in the 9th grade and how much I have improved since. Note that not all the programs I have ever written in Python will appear here - there have just been too many to keep track of in an organized and accessible manner. Rather, I will include those that I am comfortable with being seen by the general public, as well as those that I desire to keep track of through means convenient for me.

Be sure to visit my related [Advent of Code](https://www.github.com/ImpregnableProgrammer/Advent-of-Code) and [Google Code Jam](https://www.github.com/ImpregnableProgrammer/Code-Jam) repositories as well as they too revolve around the use of Python and generally contain programs that I believe are far more impressive and collectively constitute a more accurate represention of my knowledge and skillset than those shown in this repo.
